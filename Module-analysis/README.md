# Module analysis

Module analysis is a recent tool developed by [Brewe *et al.*](https://journals.aps.org/prper/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020131) that uses concepts from social network analysis (SNA) to evaluate how well item responses on a test hang together. This method can be used to determine which item responses (even wrong selections) are measuring similar concepts. `Community_Detection.py` includes functions for using [Louvain community detection](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/P10008/meta?casa_token=JoqdOrvMd60AAAAA:KskNsV4RNQwdwA2wEFrLpsDVMZPDq1DKB3r82DubnLCqu5YVwEi9F9tUjdJmvom9876G7-XHLw) to partition item responses on the Physics Lab Inventory of Critical thinking (PLIC), as well as for creating Sankey diagrams that are useful for visualizing shifts in community membership over time. We also employ the [locally adaptive network sparsification (LANS) algorithm](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016431) to sparsify our networks, eliminating insignificant edges. `PLIC_module_analysis.ipynb` includes some basic analysis illustrating the use of these tools with the PLIC.

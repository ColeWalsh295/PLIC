# Physics Lab Inventory of Critical Thinking (PLIC)

This repository includes python scripts used in the administration of the PLIC through qualtrics. This administration model also automatically analyzes collected data and sends reports to instructors summarizing the performance of their students.

We also provide an online interactive dashboard that allows instructors to explore their data in more depth and download the raw data for their class. The R code used in building this dashboard is also included in this repository.

The analyses associated with each of the projects conducted using the PLIC are also included, as well as some scripts and notebooks used for processing the data.

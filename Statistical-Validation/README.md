# Statistical validation

Here, we conduct statistical validation tests on the PLIC using tools from classical test theory and item response theory. The R notebook `PLIC_Validation.Rmd` contains the main statistical analyses, while `GetDuplicates.py` is used to generate an additional dataset of PLIC responses by students who submitted more than one valid assessment. This dataset is used in evaluations of the assessment's reliability.

# Lab analysis

Here, we use data collected using both the PLIC and Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental physics (E-CLASS) to address two research questions:

-RQ1: How do labs with different purposes affect the E-CLASS and PLIC scores for different subpopulations of students?

-RQ2: How does available agency affect students' E-CLASS and PLIC scores, and does it account for observed effects of labs with different purposes?

We use linear mixed-effects models and structural equation models to evaluate the effect of lab purpose, controlling for other student and course-level variables. Analyses are conducted in two separate notebooks, one for each assessment.
